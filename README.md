# E4 - A simplistic virtual machine in C

I'm currently learning about extremely low-level stuff in computers. From registers, to integrated-circuits. I'm going to start with a virtual machine that will mimic a future, hardware prototype of the AGC (Apollo Guidance Computer). 

I'm choosing the earliest integrated circuit computer for simplicity reasons. Later computers are extremely complicated to replicate by hand. 


## Todos

* Ability to read a program from a hexadecimal file and separate it into multiple instructions.

* Mimic the amount of registers and other hardware from the AGC
